Welcome to R-NGMM interface



R-NGMM include ergodic and non-ergodic assumptions to predict intensity measures PGV (m/s), PGA (m/sÂ²) and PSA(T) from T=0.04s to T=4.00s.

This tool can also calculate the ground motion aleatory variability components using heteroscedastic hypothesis

The .exe and .csv files can be found in the release
Run this toll in the same folder of .csv files

Extract your zip file "do not forgot to desactivate your antivirus if the exe file is deleted"
put your variables in the blanc cases in each input parameter cells "N.B : decimal variables use point (.), not comma"
choose your model "Ergodic" or "Specific-region (Regionalized partially non-ergodic)"
Select the type of VS30 
And finally click on the validate button 
After each test please refresh on "Refresh button" or clear Outputs and Sigma

Enjoy it
