Welcome to **R-NGMM** interface



**R-NGMM** include ergodic and non-ergodic assumptions to predict intensity measures _PGV (m/s), PGA (m/sÂ²)_ and _PSA(T)_ from _T=0.04s_ to _T=4.00s_.

This tool can also calculate the ground motion aleatory variability components using heteroscedastic hypothesis

The .exe and .csv files can be found in the release
Run this toll in the same folder of .csv files

Extract your zip file "Do not forget to deactivate your antivirus if the exe file is deleted"
put your variables in the blanc cases in each input parameter cell "**N.B**: decimal variables use point (.), not a comma"
choose your model "Ergodic" or "Specific-region (Regionalized partially non-ergodic)"
Select the type of _VS30_ 
And finally, click on the validate button 
After each test please refresh on the "Refresh button" or clear Outputs and Sigma

Enjoy it
